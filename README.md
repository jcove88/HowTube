## Product Description: 
For curious people who love learning new things HowTube is a web application that

of media from your favorite content creators across the web.

## Steps to Build and Run:
1. Open your favorite IDE (ex. Visual Studio Code).
2. Clone the repository to the desired directory. 
3. Navigate to the directory and run the command "npm start". 
4. A window in the browser should open up with the application running. 
5. Play the video to learn how to build legos.

## Next implementations
1. Add more videos that are pulled from a database. 
2. Search functionality to look for videos on a variety of topics
3. Category functionality to view videos on a specific topic.
